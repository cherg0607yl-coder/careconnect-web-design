Hi there!

This is CareConnect, a React app website dedicated to connecting families and volunteers with nearby hospice resources and organizations. Because many regions still face disparities in access to hospice care, I designed this webpage using the new skills I learned in web development to help create more equitable access and support people who want to make a difference.

I also included an additional feature — a Figma prototype. Here is the link:

It's only part of the project and I'll continue updating!
