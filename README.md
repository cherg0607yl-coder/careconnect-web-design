# Yutian Gong's CSSG Final Product

Hi there!

This is CareConnect, a website dedicated to connecting families and volunteers with nearby hospice resources and organizations. Because many regions still face disparities in access to hospice care, I designed this webpage using the new skills I learned in CSSG to help create more equitable access and support people who want to make a difference.

I also included an additional feature — a Figma prototype. Here is the link:

Since this is one of the busiest times of the semester, I haven't had the time to fully finish the prototype (NEVER-ENDING midterms 😭). But thank you so much for taking the time to check out my project, and thank you to the CSSG team for letting me learn so many new things!
